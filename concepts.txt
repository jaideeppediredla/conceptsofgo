9. **Goroutines and Concurrency**
   - Introduction to goroutines
   - Channels (unbuffered and buffered)
   - Select statement
   - Synchronization primitives (WaitGroup, Mutex)

10. **Error Handling**
    - Returning errors from functions
    - Custom error types
    - Handling panics with recover

11. **Packages and Imports**
    - Creating and importing packages
    - Using third-party packages with Go modules

12. **File I/O**
    - Reading and writing files
    - Understanding buffered I/O

### Advanced Concepts
13. **Testing and Benchmarking**
    - Writing tests with the testing package
    - Benchmarking functions
    - Table-driven tests

14. **Reflection**
    - Understanding the reflect package
    - Inspecting types at runtime

15. **Context Package**
    - Managing deadlines and cancellation signals
    - Context propagation in goroutines

16. **Concurrency Patterns**
    - Worker pools
    - Pipelines
    - Fan-in and fan-out

17. **Networking**
    - Creating HTTP servers and clients
    - TCP and UDP connections
    - Working with REST APIs

18. **Go Modules**
